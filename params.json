{"name":"ckon","tagline":"automatic build tool for C++ software written in the data analysis framework ROOT","body":"*ckon* is a C++ program/tool which automatically takes care of compilation,\r\ndictionary generation and linking of programs and libraries developed for data\r\nanalyses within the [CERN ROOT analysis framework](http://root.cern.ch). This\r\nincludes parsing include headers to figure out which libraries the main\r\nprograms need to be linked to. It uses\r\n[automake/autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) to be platform\r\nindependent and GNU install compliant. In addition, [m4\r\nmacros](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/The-Macros.html#The-Macros)\r\nare automatically downloaded and the according compiler flags included based on\r\na list of [boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries provided in the config file.\r\nFor the purpose of YAML database usage, a m4 macro can be downloaded during\r\nsetup to link against the [yaml-cpp](https://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/)\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nPatrick Huck ([@tschaume](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tschaume/))  \r\n*invaluable contributions* to bash/perl based predecessor: Hiroshi Masui.  \r\n*ckon* is published under [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). \r\n**Please find the docs at https://ckon.readthedocs.org**\r\n\r\n### quick install\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:tschaume/ckon.git\r\ncd ckon; ./installCkon <install-path>\r\n# replace <install-path> with an install path in your $PATH\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
