Introduction
------------

*ckon* is a C++ program/tool which automatically takes care of compilation,
dictionary generation and linking of programs and libraries developed for data
analyses within the `CERN ROOT`_ analysis framework. This includes parsing
include headers to figure out which libraries the main programs need to be
linked to. It uses `automake/autoconf`_ to be platform independent and GNU
install compliant. In addition, `m4 macros`_ are automatically downloaded and
the according compiler flags included based on a list of `boost`_ libraries
provided in the config file.  For the purpose of YAML database usage, a m4
macro can be downloaded during setup to link against the `yaml-cpp`_ library.

Installation
------------

* clone *ckon* via ``git clone git@github.com:tschaume/ckon.git``
* install via ``cd ckon; ./installCkon <install-path>``

  * replace ``<install-path>`` with an install path in your $PATH
  * see ``./installCkon -h`` for help

* see ``./configure --help`` for configure options in case something goes
  wrong
   



Usage
-----

Generic Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
Shown below are the generic command line options which can be given to *ckon*.::

  Generic Options:
   -h [ --help ]         show this help
   -v [ --verbose ]      verbose output
   -j arg                call make w/ -j <#cores>
   --ckon_cmd arg        setup | clean | install

The long option ``--ckon_cmd`` is implemented as optional positional option
to run the setup, clean all compilation products (i.e. ``make clean``) and
globally install libraries and programs (i.e. ``make install``):
   
* ``ckon setup``: run the setup
* ``ckon``: compile
* ``ckon clean``: make clean
* ``ckon install``: make install
* ``ckon dry``: only generates Makefiles, no compilation
   
Setup
^^^^^

``ckon setup`` generates the files *configure.ac* and *.autom4te.cfg* (both
autoconf specific, no need for modifications) as well as *ckon.cfg*. Modify
the latter to resemble your directory structure and linker options. Simply
remove the lines/options you don't need, thus using the default options.
   
Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following options can be set on the command line or preferably in
*ckon.cfg*. Optionally, a file named ``ckonignore`` with a list of strings to
be ignored during the build process, can be created in the working directory.
Wildcards are not supported (yet). Instead each path currently processed by
*ckon* will be checked against the strings/lines in ``ckonignore``. If one of
the strings in ``ckonignore`` is contained in the path, the path is
ignored/skipped.::
   
   Configuration:
     -s [ --suffix ] arg    add suffix + in LinkDef.h (bool)
     -y [ --yaml ] arg      use yaml
     --ckon.src_dir arg     source dir
     --ckon.exclSuffix arg  no + suffix
     --ckon.NoRootCint arg  no dictionary
     --ckon.prog_subdir arg progs subdir
     --ckon.build_dir arg   build dir
     --ckon.install_dir arg install dir
     --ckon.cppflags arg    add CPPFLAGS
     --ckon.boost arg       boost libraries
   
   In addition, unregistered options of the form
   ldadd.prog_name are allowed to use for adding
   LDFLAGS to the linker of specific programs. The
   given string/value is added verbatim in LDADD.
   Unregistered options are only allowed in ckon.cfg
   
The unregistered option group ``ldadd`` is allowed. For instance, link the
programs *genCharmContrib* and *dedxCut* versus `Pythia6`_ and `RooFit`_,
respectively, by adding the following to *ckon.cfg*.::
 
   [ldadd]
   genCharmContrib=-lPhysics -lEG -lEGPythia6  # link pythia
   dedxCut=-lRooFit -lRooFitCore -lMinuit      # link roofit
   
.. _Pythia6: http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html
.. _RooFit: http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/roofit

``ckon.boost`` is set during ``ckon setup`` to use and link against specific boost
libraries. Try not to run rootcint (``ckon.NoRootCint``) on the library if
compilation fails.

.. NOTE::
   ckon version 0.4 now allows for the automatic download of a ``yaml.m4``
   macro during ``ckon setup`` to link against the `yaml-cpp`_ library. Please
   submit an `issue`_ if the macro doesn't find the library after you installed
   it. This added functionality shouldn't break anything if you choose not to use
   YAML during ``ckon setup``.

.. WARNING::
   For the recursive header scan to work, make sure that all include directives
   for C++ and ROOT headers are enclosed in ``<...>``! Only your local/private
   headers should be enclosed in ``"..."``. Otherwise *ckon* will fail
   reporting a ``basic_string::_S_create`` error.
   
Typical Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
Put header and source files for each library into a separate folder in
``ckon.src_dir``.  Running *ckon* should automagically take the right action
for the current status of your build directory (no need to run ``ckon clean``
before re-compilation). Makefiles and LinkDefâ€™s are generated automatically
based on the contents and timestamps in the ``ckon.src_dir`` directory.
   
A typical directory structure could look as follows - using the current
defaults for illustration purposes.::

       ElectronPid/
           BetaPanels.cxx
           BetaPanels.h
